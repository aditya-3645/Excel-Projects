1.Data â€“ Contains the raw transactional dataset.
2.Pivot Tables â€“ Pre-built summary tables to analyze sales and profit trends across different dimensions.
3.Dashboard â€“ A visualization layer summarizing key insights from the pivot tables.

2.Year / Month: Derived fields for time-based analysis.
3.Customer Name: Name of the customer who made the purchase.
4.State: Geographic location of the customer (U.S. states).
5.Category: Broad classification of the product (e.g., Office Supplies, Furniture, Technology).
6.Sub-Category: More detailed classification (e.g., Paper, Binders, Storage).
7.Product Name: The specific product sold.
8.Sales: Revenue generated from the transaction (numeric).
9.Quantity: Number of units sold (integer).
10.Profit: Profit (or loss if negative) from the sale (numeric).

1.Sales trend analysis across time (monthly, yearly).
2.Profitability by category, sub-category, product, or region.
3.Customer segmentation by purchase behavior.
4.State-wise sales and profit performance.
